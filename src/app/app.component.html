  Work-around to ensure that the `.woff2` file for the 'Material Icons' font will always be fetched.
  This allows the SW to cache the file (even if there are no icons in the current page) and ensure
  material icons on other pages are displayed correctly in offline mode.
  (Note: Instantiate lazily to avoid affecting the initial rendering.)
